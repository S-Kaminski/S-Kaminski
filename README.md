<!-- Introduction -->
Hello, I'm Simon, a passionate software developer with a love for open-source projects.  

I am an individual who is open to challenges and driven to expand my skill set. I handle assigned tasks and encountered problems with ease. When faced with difficulties or challenges, I possess the ability to analyze and efficiently search for relevant information and solutions in the subject matter, enabling me to effectively address challenges and achieve solutions.

I have been an engaged participant in Lionbridge’s game testing program, operating under stringent anti-leak  
policies (NDA). Additionally, served as a dedicated Java tutor for fellow college students. I am proficient in  
preparing comprehensive reports and providing impactful assistance to team members.
